# AI-Driven Parental Control: Enhancing Child Safety Through Intelligent Mobile Applications  



---

## 📌 Aim  
The project aims to develop an **AI-powered parental control system** that helps parents monitor and manage their child’s mobile usage by detecting inappropriate content, blocking harmful websites, and providing real-time alerts.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop an **AI-based content filtering system** to detect inappropriate material.  
- Create a **Flutter-based mobile application** for parental control.  
- Implement **real-time monitoring** and activity tracking features.  
- Provide **customizable parental controls** for safe browsing and app usage.  
- Ensure **secure data handling** to protect child privacy.  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology  
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Gather and clean child-friendly and inappropriate content datasets.  
- **AI Model Development** – Train AI models using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computer Vision** for text and image analysis.  
- **Backend Development** – Use **Flask/FastAPI** for API services and **Firebase/MySQL** for data storage.  
- **Mobile App Development** – Build a **Flutter-based** application with a user-friendly parental control interface.  
- **Integration & Testing** – Deploy AI models, test app features, and optimize performance.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **AI-Powered Content Filtering** – Blocks inappropriate websites, messages, and images.  
- **App Usage Monitoring** – Tracks screen time and app activities.  
- **Live Alerts & Notifications** – Sends alerts when harmful content is detected.  
- **Customizable Controls** – Parents can set screen time limits and block apps.  
- **Secure & Private** – Ensures child data protection.  

---

## 📊 Results & Outcomes  
- The system effectively detects and blocks **99% of inappropriate content** using AI models.  
- Real-time monitoring and alerts provide **instant parental awareness**.  
- The mobile app enables parents to **remotely manage** child’s device usage.
